**Space News** is a dummy website concept designed to deliver messages across the galaxy without the need for any electronic communication tools. The idea is a playful take on intergalactic news delivery, providing a fun and imaginative platform for sending physical information media  beyond Earth.

## Tools Used

- **Adobe Illustrator**: Used for designing and creating the art assets.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Core logic and DOM manipulation.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **HTML5**: Markup structure.
- **WordPress**: Platform for content management and deployment.

## Time Spent on Each Part

- **Design & Ideation**: 1 work day was dedicated to setting the overall idea and preparing the art files in Illustrator.
- **Implementation**: 1 work day was spent on coding, integrating the design, and setting up on WordPress.

## Challenges Faced & How They Were Solved

- **Parallax Art Export Issues**: The artwork for the parallax effect was not exporting with correct artboard locations from Illustrator.  
  **Solution**: I manually set the correct locations in code on the website to achieve the desired effect.
  - **Improvement for Future**: If available, I would use software or a plugin that exports art assets along with their positions to streamline this process.

- **Framework Choices**: Using a modern library like React could have sped up development and improved maintainability, and WordPress does support React.  
  **Constraint**: The project requirements specified vanilla JavaScript, so I adhered to that despite the potential benefits.

## Improvements With More Time

- More time would be spent on fine-tuning the UI and adding polish to the visual appearance.
- I would implement an emailing service for user interaction or notifications.
- Adding a more advanced CMS for feature management and easier content updates.

## Bugs or Limitations

- Manual positioning of parallax art assets can be error-prone and time-consuming.
- The project currently lacks advanced interactivity like emailing features and a robust CMS.
- UI refinements were limited by time constraints.
